## Java Project Ideas for Beginners

### 1. Student Management System
- Create a simple console-based application to manage student records.
- Implement classes for Student, Course, and Enrollment using OOP principles.
- Use JDBC to connect to a database (e.g., MySQL) to store and retrieve student information.
- Features can include adding new students, enrolling students in courses, viewing student details, etc.

### 2. Library Management System
- Develop a library management system that allows users to manage books, borrowers, and loans.
- Use classes like Book, Member, and Loan to represent entities in the system.
- Implement CRUD operations for managing library resources.
- Utilize JDBC for database operations to store book and member information.

### 3. Employee Payroll System
- Build an employee payroll system to calculate salaries and manage employee records.
- Define classes for Employee, Department, and Salary using OOP concepts.
- Implement features such as adding new employees, calculating salaries based on hours worked or fixed salaries, generating payroll reports, etc.
- Use JDBC to interact with a database to store employee data and salary information.

### 4. Banking Application
- Develop a simple banking application that allows users to perform basic banking operations.
- Create classes like Account, Customer, and Transaction to model bank entities.
- Implement features such as creating new accounts, depositing and withdrawing funds, transferring money between accounts, etc.
- Use JDBC for database operations to store account and customer details.

### 5. Inventory Management System
- Build an inventory management system to track products, suppliers, and orders.
- Define classes for Product, Supplier, and Order using OOP principles.
- Implement functionalities like adding new products, managing supplier information, placing and processing orders, etc.
- Utilize JDBC for database interactions to store inventory and order information.

### 6. Task Management Application
- Create a task management application to manage tasks and assignments for teams or individuals.
- Implement classes like Task, User, and Project to represent entities in the system.
- Develop features such as creating new tasks, assigning tasks to users, tracking task progress, etc.
- Use JDBC to store task and user information in a database.

These project ideas offer practical scenarios for applying Java programming, OOP principles, and JDBC concepts. Start with a simple project, gradually add more features, and challenge yourself to improve your skills along the way. Remember to break down the project into smaller tasks and focus on understanding each concept thoroughly as you progress. Good luck with your Java journey!
